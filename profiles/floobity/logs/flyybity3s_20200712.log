Type 'news' to see the news screen.
You remove your setting for MAPCOLS.
You will now see the HP bar on your main screen as well.
You prepare strands of goldenrod silk with the power of mandrake
root.  Ancient powers coalesce into the strands, causing them to
lengthen and encircle your body.  A strange sensation of power is
conferred upon you as the aura forms itself to your bodily frame.
  Master, you have used your last protection.

As you look over your shoulder, you see a thick wooden door through which
you entered. Now you know why they call this the Ancient Archives of
the Dead! This library was opened by Thanamere, after he was revived!
Since that time he has collected scrolls of every type, thus he hopes
to aid his fellow undead in their quest for glory! A plaque is carefully
hung on the wall. For info and help type 'say hi' || 'say scroll'.

Your skin crawls as you enter this darkened tomb.  The flickering

You feel a shiver of excitement as the dormant magics surrounding 
this place flare to life, swirling about you in unseen fury.

As you watch, the dark obsidian coffin slides slowly aside to 
reveal a dark stairway leading beneath the crypts.

You wander down the corridor towards the light
A half dozen magical braziers flare to life as you cross the 
threshold into the cavernous chamber.
The well of binding (s)
=I= Braziers of a shimmering black metal.
l
You stand in a gigantic cavern nearly one hundred feet across. 
Blazing braziers light the chamber, reflecting off the smoothed 
walls and floor to chase the shadows into hiding.  Small alcoves 
are intermittantly spaced about the cavern's walls, dark recesses 
escaping the light of the braziers.  Two large stalactites hang 
beside a third, smaller one near the center of the cavern's 
ceiling.  At the very center of the cavern the very floor drops 
away, leaving a dark abyss, bridged only by two small walkways 
which lead to the small circular island at the well's center.
=X=    There is one obvious exit: south                                        =X=

l at island
Two slender walkways meld seamlessly with the stone rimming the 
well.  The small island hanging above the abyss seems to be held by 
only these two bridges.  You can't quite make out the details of 
the island from here, to do that you'll have to cross over to it.

cross over
You step onto the thin walkway, trying not to look down.
You make a supreme effort not to look down into the bottomless darkness 
of the well as you carefully walk along the thin band of rock.
Releasing a breath you didn't realize you held, you step off the 
catwalk and onto the small island above the abyss.
The center of the well
=I= A circle of glowing runes.
=I= An ancient brazier holding a magical flame.
l
You've crossed the narrow catwalk to stand within a rune encrusted 
circle scribed into the grey stone of the small island.  The 
darkness of the well surrounds you, the light of the braziers 
barely illuminating the small circle.  Charred patches of stone mar 
the smooth surface here and there, though never marring the ring of 
runes.  Your mind reels with a sense of vertigo, forcing you to 
focus on the slate grey stone beneath your feet for fear of falling 
into the abyss below.

A grey colored brazier, its shallow bowl holding dancing flames. 
Its three legs carved into the likeness of some creature's talons. 
The talons are sunk into the stone, holding the brazier in place.

Ancient runes inscribed by magic into the very stone you stand 
upon.  Though unfamiliar to you, you can feel the pulse of 
protective magics still flowing between them, simply waiting to be 
activated once more.

You've crossed the narrow catwalk to stand within a rune encrusted 
circle scribed into the grey stone of the small island.  The 
darkness of the well surrounds you, the light of the braziers 
barely illuminating the small circle.  Charred patches of stone mar 
the smooth surface here and there, though never marring the ring of 
runes.  Your mind reels with a sense of vertigo, forcing you to 
focus on the slate grey stone beneath your feet for fear of falling 
into the abyss below.

You stand in a gigantic cavern nearly one hundred feet across. 
Blazing braziers light the chamber, reflecting off the smoothed 
walls and floor to chase the shadows into hiding.  Small alcoves 
are intermittantly spaced about the cavern's walls, dark recesses 
escaping the light of the braziers.  Two large stalactites hang 
beside a third, smaller one near the center of the cavern's 
ceiling.  At the very center of the cavern the very floor drops 
away, leaving a dark abyss, bridged only by two small walkways 
which lead to the small circular island at the well's center.
