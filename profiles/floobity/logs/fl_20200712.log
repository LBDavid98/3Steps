[[MORPH]]: Chaotic forces surge and broil as Fl enters the realm.
You are login #197 this boot.
There have been 307556 logins since Mon May 25 11:48:56 2009.
[PARTY] Forming new party: Fl's party.
You set your mywho names to your watch list.
With sheer focus of mind, you begin pumping adrenaline into your body,
enabling you to attack with increased ferocity!                            
You begin to concentrate on accelerating your natural regeneration process.
You isolate a small sphere of protoplasm, hardening the outside then
separating it to form an egg.  Inside, your clone is free to grow and
develop in relative safety.                                                
3Scapes welcomes you!
