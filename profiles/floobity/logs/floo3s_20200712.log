3Scapes welcomes you!
You concentrate on the ebb and flow of the Force about you, searching
for the subtle patterns within the fragile web.  With the force of your
will alone you gather the Force about you in a cocoon of pure energy.
You stretch out your feelings to the world around you, touching things
living and non.  With a twist of the Force you draw the power around
you like a cocoon of pure energy.
You draw upon the Force to help you anticipate attacks.
You do not have a drawn guild weapon.
You draw your weapon from the sheath in your belt.
You wield offhand blaster.
You will now fight using your weapon's standard mode.
You adjust your grip on your blaster and steady your mind, focusing on a
single point in your thoughts, readying to unleash the Force with your
blaster and knowing you will strike your target.                        
That's not being smuggled...
Your offhand blaster doesn't need recharging.
You close your eyes briefly, feeling the ebb and flow of the force stretch
through your being.  Your eyes flutter open as you call upon your control
of the force to deflect incoming attacks.
You begin to concentrate on healing your wounds.
You will no longer see the HP bar on the main screen.
You remove your setting for MAPCOLS.
You will now see the HP bar on your main screen as well.
Type 'news' to see the news screen.
