3Scapes welcomes you!
You concentrate on the ebb and flow of the Force about you, searching
for the subtle patterns within the fragile web.  With the force of your
will alone you gather the Force about you in a cocoon of pure energy.
You stretch out your feelings to the world around you, touching things
living and non.  With a twist of the Force you draw the power around
you like a cocoon of pure energy.
You draw upon the Force to help you anticipate attacks.
You do not have a drawn guild weapon.
You draw your weapon from the sheath in your belt.
You wield offhand blaster.
You will now fight using your weapon's standard mode.
You adjust your grip on your blaster and steady your mind, focusing on a
single point in your thoughts, readying to unleash the Force with your
blaster and knowing you will strike your target.                        
That's not being smuggled...
Your offhand blaster doesn't need recharging.
You close your eyes briefly, feeling the ebb and flow of the force stretch
through your being.  Your eyes flutter open as you call upon your control
of the force to deflect incoming attacks.
You begin to concentrate on healing your wounds.
You will no longer see the HP bar on the main screen.
You remove your setting for MAPCOLS.
You will now see the HP bar on your main screen as well.
Type 'news' to see the news screen.

The tunnel begins to widen here as you see huge voids in the walls where raw materials have been
extracted. The pale blue light coming from the south brightens the room and allows you to get your

be responsible.

The bracers flare out in a shower of light, your form shimmers and
fades momentarily, the force of your opponents attack passes right
through you, fueling your life force rather than draining!

As you reach another dead end, the cave fills with light. There are four braziers forming a square
placed around a shimmering blue portal. The portal is suspended in midair and makes a low-pitched
humming sound as you get close to it. It looks like a much wider cave system with large sections of
water as you stare through the portal. Behind the portal, there are multicolored stalagmites of all
sizes near the cave walls. There are also several chests lined up adjacent to the portal.
