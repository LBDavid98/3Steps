Very carefully, you build a Bridge to the Astral world beyond the Veil,
spinning it out of the pure energy of the sorcerous star.
Otherworldly energies flow into our material world in a controlled

you are on the tip of a great mountain, clouds wreathing the vast bulk
of stone beneath you and howling supernal dream-winds cleansing you of
thought and history. The planes overlap here in mind-bending layers, the
Veil thinner here than anywhere else in the world. This might be a good
place to <meditate>, or to <scour> your spirit with astral powers.

Sauk is the head mage for the entire realm of the Northern Wall.
He was once one of the greatest members of the Legion of the Storm, but
the time he spent within its ranks has distorted his view of right and
wrong and bent him towards evil.  Possibly one of the most powerful
mages in all the land, his magic is rivaled only by that of the Drow
Queen, Vasynase.
Golden blades dance around his body.

You twine complex energies through the summoned forces, building
intricate loops and helices, linking them simultaneously to both worlds
in an Astral Matrix.
Giant Donut screeches in agony and falls to the ground, dead.
A nexus of inevitability dealt the killing blow to Giant Donut.
Your reputation with Donut Slayers has increased slightly.
The riptide ebbs back into the astral.
You pick up The skinless, freshly slain corpse of Giant donut and wrap
it up into the coffin's protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
There are no coins here to share!
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
The brine of an ethereal ocean floods into the area, shrouding everything
in dim aquatic peace. Powerful currents tug at the body of the recently-
dead, dragging it out to sea and to silence.
The umbral tides sweep through you, bitter cold but refreshing.

Mmm, the delicious smell of cinnamon floats along the air in this
spacious corridor. The pungent spice seems to coat every surface you
can see. It flakes off the ceiling and walls and covers the floor in a
thin, fragrant layer. Cinnamon is said to be good for you, but you
might want to be careful. There's enough of it in here to choke a
horse.
