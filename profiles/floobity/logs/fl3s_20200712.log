This room is utterly packed with vials and scrolls and beakers and

Fl arrives.
You are at the rogue encampment. This quiet outpost is on the edge of
a vast wilderness, covered in a blanket of eerie fog. Various
buildings surround you, with a few individuals roaming the street. A
large wagon sits in the center of town, and an interesting looking hut
lies a short walk away.

Warriv packs the bags for the caravan and you start on your long journey.
The journey should haven taken weeks, but ends up being over after a brief
loading screen.
Cain says: Greetings hero. With Andariel slain, the time has come to
           pursue the Dark Wanderer through the lands of the east. Before
           we can find him, however, there is something we need to find.  
This is the town square of Lut Gholein. Roads lead in all directions
and people come and go on the streets. Guards patrol enforcing law and
order. To the north you see a large military structure, and to the
west you can make out a market. To the south is a slum and to the east
is a gate leading out of town. An entertainer sits at one corner of
the square, while a crier calls out news in another.

This is the town square of Lut Gholein. Roads lead in all directions
and people come and go on the streets. Guards patrol enforcing law and
order. To the north you see a large military structure, and to the
west you can make out a market. To the south is a slum and to the east
is a gate leading out of town. An entertainer sits at one corner of
the square, while a crier calls out news in another.

This is the east exit of the town of Lut Gholein. A large arch rises
overhead and crosses the street which leads out of town. To the north,
the sounds of city life rise and fade as people go about their
business. To the east the desert swallows the landscape and is kept
away from the city by its high walls.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains

An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only

Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from

still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only

baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from

A series of large stone blocks are arranged in a large formation. A
rectangular opening large enough to fit a man leads into the rock
formation. A few scattered bones lay around the entrance, one of which
has a large raven sitting on it looking at you intently. There is a
large gap between the entrance of this tomb and the closest plant.
Tracks lead in and out of the opening which is dark and ominous.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

In the distance you see a leaper jumping towards you.

Lurke gasps for breath, then slumps into death.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Lurke.
Lurke's brain is turned to mush.                                           
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Lurke and wrap it up into the coffin's protective
hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 2096 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 2096 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating an opaque bioplast with the raw
protoplasm you obtain.                                                     
bioplast: Taken.
Ok.
There are no corpses here to wrap!

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Cat gurgles in her own blood as she dies.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Cat.
Blood splatters on you.
Cat's brain is turned to mush.                                             
You pick up The electrocuted, freshly slain corpse of Cat and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 2004 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 2004 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating an opaque bioplast with the raw
protoplasm you obtain.                                                     
bioplast: Taken.
Ok.
There are no corpses here to wrap!

You tell Niall: I think changelings don't really feel bad once you get over
        the hump.. it's not light speed, but it always feels like progress
The chaotic forces seeking control of you begin to wane, your control
returning as the energies cease to course chaotically through you.
You relinquish yourself to Chaos, and immediately feel the unpredictable
and powerful forces surge through you, threatening to sweep you away in an
instant!
Your body ripples and shakes as energy flows into you.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay

occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the

Lurke gasps for breath, then slumps into death.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Lurke.
Lurke's brain is turned to mush.

Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The Lurke cries out to its broodmates!
In the distance you see a leaper jumping towards you.
Lurke gurgles in her own blood as she dies.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Lurke.
Lurke's brain is turned to mush.                                           
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Lurke and wrap it up into the coffin's protective

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in
that direction. Disturbed stones plummet a good thirty feet before
clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in
that direction. Disturbed stones plummet a good thirty feet before
clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

the bottom, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over
the place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

up towards the top and you are able to walk either north towards the
top, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a

bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

The east face of a large mountain blocks passage to the west. It
towers high over the desert, casting a giant shadow over the land. The
base of the mountain is fairly steep and its surface is barren of any
plant life. The desert around the mountain is populated with the
occasional cactus and scrub brush. Small collections of rocks are
scattered all around the base showing sides of rock slides in the
past.

The west face of a large mountain blocks passage to the east. This
side of the mountain appears to be the windward side and catches
whatever minimal precipitation happens to be in the air. As such, a
motley collection of plants cling for dear life on the bottom half of
the mountain slope. The desert beyond them to the west is basked in
the oppressive weight of the sun. There are no signs of plants out
there.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

Your thumbs are too tired to gouge right now...
Vulture gurgles in her own blood as she dies.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Vulture.
Vulture's brain is turned to mush.                                         
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Vulture and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

Vulture gasps for breath, then slumps into death.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Vulture.
Vulture's brain is turned to mush.                                         
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Vulture and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 1920 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 1920 coins.

You flow over the corpse, creating a milky bioplast with the raw protoplasm
you obtain.

into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

An enormous staircase descends down into a large ruin that rises out
of the desert sand. The staircase is encased in a giant rectangular
structure that shields it from the elements. Flanking either side of
the structure are statues of warriors with their weapons held as if to
block intruders. An unnatural howl of agony enters the mind of anyone
who looks at the stairs for too long.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Your thumbs are too tired to gouge right now...
The chaotic forces seeking control of you begin to wane, your control
returning as the energies cease to course chaotically through you.

You relinquish yourself to Chaos, and immediately feel the unpredictable

You have come to the edge of the cliff. The low edge slowly meanders
up towards the top and you are able to walk either north towards the
top, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

You have come to the edge of the cliff. The high edge slowly meanders
down towards the ground and you are able to walk either south towards
the bottom, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over
the place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The west face of a large mountain blocks passage to the east. This
side of the mountain appears to be the windward side and catches
whatever minimal precipitation happens to be in the air. As such, a
motley collection of plants cling for dear life on the bottom half of
the mountain slope. The desert beyond them to the west is basked in
the oppressive weight of the sun. There are no signs of plants out

The south face of a large mountain blocks passage to the north. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large
bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The west face of a large mountain blocks passage to the east. This
side of the mountain appears to be the windward side and catches
whatever minimal precipitation happens to be in the air. As such, a
motley collection of plants cling for dear life on the bottom half of
the mountain slope. The desert beyond them to the west is basked in
the oppressive weight of the sun. There are no signs of plants out
there.

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large
bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

You have come to the edge of the cliff. The low edge slowly meanders
up towards the top and you are able to walk either north towards the
top, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in

clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land

leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

You have come to the edge of the cliff. The low edge slowly meanders
up towards the top and you are able to walk either north towards the
top, or west along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Vulture's brain is turned to mush.                                         
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Vulture and wrap it up into the coffin's

The coffin is now full!

You flow over the corpse, creating a milky bioplast with the raw protoplasm
you obtain.

still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is

every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The Hell Swarm Insects form into inkblot-like shapes.
You relinquish yourself to Chaos, and immediately feel the unpredictable
and powerful forces surge through you, threatening to sweep you away in an
instant!
Hell Swarm Insects screeches in agony and falls to the ground, dead.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Hell Swarm Insects.
Hell Swarm Insects's brain is turned to mush.                              
You pick up The melted, freshly slain corpse of Hell swarm insects and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 1834 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 1834 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a translucent bioplast with the raw
protoplasm you obtain.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land

in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in
that direction. Disturbed stones plummet a good thirty feet before
clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

Healthy plants are all gathered around the still, tranquil water. Even
the sun doesn't seem as bright as it forms a perfect reflection on the
water's surface. A few small creatures drink and play near the water.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large
bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

plant life. The desert around the mountain is populated with the
occasional cactus and scrub brush. Small collections of rocks are

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

You are at the rogue encampment. This quiet outpost is on the edge of

buildings surround you, with a few individuals roaming the street. A
large wagon sits in the center of town, and an interesting looking hut
lies a short walk away.

This is the town square of Lut Gholein. Roads lead in all directions
and people come and go on the streets. Guards patrol enforcing law and
order. To the north you see a large military structure, and to the
west you can make out a market. To the south is a slum and to the east
is a gate leading out of town. An entertainer sits at one corner of
the square, while a crier calls out news in another.

This is the town square of Lut Gholein. Roads lead in all directions
and people come and go on the streets. Guards patrol enforcing law and
order. To the north you see a large military structure, and to the
west you can make out a market. To the south is a slum and to the east
is a gate leading out of town. An entertainer sits at one corner of
the square, while a crier calls out news in another.

This is the east exit of the town of Lut Gholein. A large arch rises
overhead and crosses the street which leads out of town. To the north,
the sounds of city life rise and fade as people go about their
business. To the east the desert swallows the landscape and is kept
away from the city by its high walls.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land

in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long

still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

Vulture screeches in agony and falls to the ground, dead.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Vulture.
Vulture's brain is turned to mush.                                         
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Vulture and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

A series of large stone blocks are arranged in a large formation. A
rectangular opening large enough to fit a man leads into the rock
formation. A few scattered bones lay around the entrance, one of which
has a large raven sitting on it looking at you intently. There is a
large gap between the entrance of this tomb and the closest plant.
Tracks lead in and out of the opening which is dark and ominous.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The Lurke cries out to its broodmates!
The Lurke drools.
Lurke screeches in agony and falls to the ground, dead.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Lurke.
Blood splatters on you.
Lurke's brain is turned to mush.                                           
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Lurke and wrap it up into the coffin's protective
hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 2096 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 2096 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a milky bioplast with the raw protoplasm
you obtain.

Ok.
There are no corpses here to wrap!

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The Cat purrs eerily at you.
Cat screeches in agony and falls to the ground, dead.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Cat.
Cat's brain is turned to mush.                                             
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Cat and wrap it up into the coffin's protective
hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 1848 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 1848 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a translucent bioplast with the raw
protoplasm you obtain.                                                     
bioplast: Taken.
Ok.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in
that direction. Disturbed stones plummet a good thirty feet before
clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

20:14 To: Niall : I think changelings don't really feel bad once you get
                  over the hump.. it's not light speed, but it always feels
                  like progress
20:15 To: Niall : which is kind of rare... most guilds hit a plateau and
                  improving more sucks
20:15 Zirzan : this is all above my computer paygrade lol
20:15 Zirzan : i just spent the last hour cleaning silly string
20:15 Niall : its cause that hump is truly suck! glad I'm over it
20:15 Zirzan : and still have some to clean
20:15 To: Zirzan : you might not undrestand everything, but you will be able
                   to play
20:16 Zirzan : oh i didnt even fully understand what or how i was
               installing
20:16 To: Zirzan : we can have you up and running in like 10 mins
20:16 Zirzan : so i was like nerp, i feel like my parents wanting them to
               fix their phones
20:16 To: Zirzan : heh heh
20:17 To: Niall : It took me like a month and a half
20:17 To: Niall : to get 1-100
20:18 Niall : yeah it was rough!
20:18 To: Niall : but after that it pretty quickly became my favorite guild
20:18 Zirzan : my son did that and then he got himself some water and
               dropped and broke a glass. lol
20:19 Zirzan : serenity now!

20:41 To: Haran : just play vulture until glv 100
20:42 Rahan : until 100? lol
20:42 To: Rahan : well, more ff = less stamina/rnd
20:42 Rahan : yeah
20:42 To: Rahan : so if you don't mind losing the progress on other forms,
                  it's more efficient
20:42 Rahan : yeah
20:43 Rahan : and then when you have 2 rel, it just doesnt matter
20:43 Rahan : there are better tanks though right?
20:43 To: Rahan : yeah
20:43 Rahan : it was extremely both, but i bet it flying has its own
              thing
20:43 To: Rahan : yeah, I think it's possible there are penalties for
                  special abilities
20:44 To: Rahan : or just different resistances
20:44 Rahan : yeah
20:44 To: Rahan : but really, none of the forms I have ever tried felt _bad_
                  just different
20:44 To: Rahan : want plasts?
20:44 Rahan : sure
20:44 To: Rahan : cot
20:45 Rahan : okay try more
20:45 Rahan : thanks!
20:45 To: Rahan : nog
20:46 To: Rahan : if you go to phoebe, you can see she has like 2000 of them
                  too
20:46 To: Rahan : so it's like the necro morgue onc rack
20:46 To: Rahan : on crack
20:46 Rahan : nice!
20:46 To: Rahan : eat em up, you got 4.1 days
20:47 To: Rahan : with a lot of changers on, that's a shitload of plasts
20:48 To: Niall : I really like how bioplasts make us pretty much better
                  necros too
20:48 Rahan : aa
20:48 To: Rahan : aa?
20:48 Rahan : sorry
20:48 Rahan : what stats?
20:48 To: Rahan : to get?
20:48 Rahan : in general
20:49 To: Rahan : con is most important at first
20:49 Niall : yup and I like to constantly stock up and do other forms
              with it
20:49 To: Rahan : makes more stamina
Rahan LTs (Fl)

Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large
bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

The east face of a large mountain blocks passage to the west. It
towers high over the desert, casting a giant shadow over the land. The
base of the mountain is fairly steep and its surface is barren of any
plant life. The desert around the mountain is populated with the
occasional cactus and scrub brush. Small collections of rocks are
scattered all around the base showing sides of rock slides in the
past.

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large
bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

The west face of a large mountain blocks passage to the east. This
side of the mountain appears to be the windward side and catches
whatever minimal precipitation happens to be in the air. As such, a
motley collection of plants cling for dear life on the bottom half of
the mountain slope. The desert beyond them to the west is basked in
the oppressive weight of the sun. There are no signs of plants out
there.

20:16 To: Zirzan : we can have you up and running in like 10 mins
20:16 Zirzan : so i was like nerp, i feel like my parents wanting them to
               fix their phones
20:16 To: Zirzan : heh heh
20:17 To: Niall : It took me like a month and a half
20:17 To: Niall : to get 1-100
20:18 Niall : yeah it was rough!
20:18 To: Niall : but after that it pretty quickly became my favorite guild
20:18 Zirzan : my son did that and then he got himself some water and
               dropped and broke a glass. lol
20:19 Zirzan : serenity now!
20:20 Niall : I'm really getting into it too. much less limiting than
              others
20:40 Haran : no clue what to play lol
20:41 To: Haran : changeling!
20:41 To: Haran : I can feed you a bunch of plasts
20:41 To: Haran : just play vulture until glv 100
20:42 Rahan : until 100? lol
20:42 To: Rahan : well, more ff = less stamina/rnd
20:42 Rahan : yeah
20:42 To: Rahan : so if you don't mind losing the progress on other forms,
                  it's more efficient
20:42 Rahan : yeah
20:43 Rahan : and then when you have 2 rel, it just doesnt matter
20:43 Rahan : there are better tanks though right?
20:43 To: Rahan : yeah
20:43 Rahan : it was extremely both, but i bet it flying has its own
              thing
20:43 To: Rahan : yeah, I think it's possible there are penalties for
                  special abilities
20:44 To: Rahan : or just different resistances
20:44 Rahan : yeah
20:44 To: Rahan : but really, none of the forms I have ever tried felt _bad_
                  just different
20:44 To: Rahan : want plasts?
20:44 Rahan : sure
20:44 To: Rahan : cot
20:45 Rahan : okay try more
20:45 Rahan : thanks!
20:45 To: Rahan : nog
20:46 To: Rahan : if you go to phoebe, you can see she has like 2000 of them
                  too
20:46 To: Rahan : so it's like the necro morgue onc rack
20:46 To: Rahan : on crack
20:46 Rahan : nice!
20:46 To: Rahan : eat em up, you got 4.1 days
20:47 To: Rahan : with a lot of changers on, that's a shitload of plasts
20:48 To: Niall : I really like how bioplasts make us pretty much better
                  necros too
20:48 Rahan : aa
20:48 To: Rahan : aa?
20:48 Rahan : sorry
20:48 Rahan : what stats?
20:48 To: Rahan : to get?
20:48 Rahan : in general
20:49 To: Rahan : con is most important at first
20:49 Niall : yup and I like to constantly stock up and do other forms
              with it
20:49 To: Rahan : makes more stamina
20:50 Rahan : but at 100 with 2 rel, stam pretty much stops mattering
20:50 Rahan : right?
20:50 To: Rahan : and int to 50-70.. and str/wis after that
20:50 To: Rahan : give or take
20:50 Rahan : no dex?
20:50 To: Rahan : uhh yeah, I suppose so
20:50 To: Rahan : dex does fuckall, as far as I can tell
20:50 Rahan : not even for like mud-side dex boosts
20:51 Rahan : but that does make things easy
20:51 To: Rahan : yeah, but that is insignificant in comparison to resil
20:51 Rahan : is it str for e/b and wis for all others?
20:51 To: Rahan : I have 177 str, 50 dex, 100 wis, 70 int, 150 con, 20 cha
20:51 To: Rahan : no, str for everything

Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The Vulture hisses.
Vulture gurgles in his own blood as he dies.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Vulture.
Vulture's brain is turned to mush.                                         
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Vulture and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 2090 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 2090 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a milky bioplast with the raw protoplasm
you obtain.                                                                
bioplast: Taken.
Ok.
There are no corpses here to wrap!

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Tell history:
20:16 To: Zirzan : heh heh
20:17 To: Niall : It took me like a month and a half
20:17 To: Niall : to get 1-100
20:18 Niall : yeah it was rough!
20:18 To: Niall : but after that it pretty quickly became my favorite guild
20:18 Zirzan : my son did that and then he got himself some water and
               dropped and broke a glass. lol
20:19 Zirzan : serenity now!
20:20 Niall : I'm really getting into it too. much less limiting than
              others
20:40 Haran : no clue what to play lol
20:41 To: Haran : changeling!
20:41 To: Haran : I can feed you a bunch of plasts
20:41 To: Haran : just play vulture until glv 100
20:42 Rahan : until 100? lol
20:42 To: Rahan : well, more ff = less stamina/rnd
20:42 Rahan : yeah
20:42 To: Rahan : so if you don't mind losing the progress on other forms,
                  it's more efficient
20:42 Rahan : yeah
20:43 Rahan : and then when you have 2 rel, it just doesnt matter
20:43 Rahan : there are better tanks though right?
20:43 To: Rahan : yeah
20:43 Rahan : it was extremely both, but i bet it flying has its own
              thing
20:43 To: Rahan : yeah, I think it's possible there are penalties for
                  special abilities
20:44 To: Rahan : or just different resistances
20:44 Rahan : yeah
20:44 To: Rahan : but really, none of the forms I have ever tried felt _bad_
                  just different
20:44 To: Rahan : want plasts?
20:44 Rahan : sure
20:44 To: Rahan : cot
20:45 Rahan : okay try more
20:45 Rahan : thanks!
20:45 To: Rahan : nog
20:46 To: Rahan : if you go to phoebe, you can see she has like 2000 of them
                  too
20:46 To: Rahan : so it's like the necro morgue onc rack
20:46 To: Rahan : on crack
20:46 Rahan : nice!
20:46 To: Rahan : eat em up, you got 4.1 days
20:47 To: Rahan : with a lot of changers on, that's a shitload of plasts
20:48 To: Niall : I really like how bioplasts make us pretty much better
                  necros too
20:48 Rahan : aa
20:48 To: Rahan : aa?
20:48 Rahan : sorry
20:48 Rahan : what stats?
20:48 To: Rahan : to get?
20:48 Rahan : in general
20:49 To: Rahan : con is most important at first
20:49 Niall : yup and I like to constantly stock up and do other forms
              with it
20:49 To: Rahan : makes more stamina
20:50 Rahan : but at 100 with 2 rel, stam pretty much stops mattering
20:50 Rahan : right?
20:50 To: Rahan : and int to 50-70.. and str/wis after that
20:50 To: Rahan : give or take
20:50 Rahan : no dex?
20:50 To: Rahan : uhh yeah, I suppose so
20:50 To: Rahan : dex does fuckall, as far as I can tell
20:50 Rahan : not even for like mud-side dex boosts
20:51 Rahan : but that does make things easy
20:51 To: Rahan : yeah, but that is insignificant in comparison to resil
20:51 Rahan : is it str for e/b and wis for all others?
20:51 To: Rahan : I have 177 str, 50 dex, 100 wis, 70 int, 150 con, 20 cha
20:51 To: Rahan : no, str for everything
20:51 To: Rahan : wis for everything

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the

protoplasm you obtain.                                                     
bioplast: Taken.
Ok.
There are no corpses here to wrap!

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to

signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out

by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

You have come to the edge of the cliff. The low edge slowly meanders
up towards the top and you are able to walk either north towards the
top, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large
bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

You have come to the edge of the cliff. The low edge slowly meanders
up towards the top and you are able to walk either north towards the
top, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in
that direction. Disturbed stones plummet a good thirty feet before
clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

You have come to the edge of the cliff. The low edge slowly meanders
up towards the top and you are able to walk either north towards the
top, or west along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few
plants are scattered here and there.

Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

Your thumbs are too tired to gouge right now...
Vulture screeches in agony and falls to the ground, dead.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Vulture.
Vulture's brain is turned to mush.                                         
You pick up The brainless, freshly slain corpse of Vulture and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
[PARTY] Divvy of 1834 coins called by Fl.
Your share is 1834 coins.
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a milky bioplast with the raw protoplasm
you obtain.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in
that direction. Disturbed stones plummet a good thirty feet before
clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

A massive cliff drop to the south makes it impossible to continue in

clattering to a stop at the bottom. There are no handholds or
footholds to aid in climbing down the face. The desert continues away
from this cliff to the north and the cliff edge runs to the east and
west. You can see a great distance to south from this high vantage but
nothing of note stands out.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A beautiful, but small oasis stands in this area of the desert. A
picturesque pond sits in a depression in the sand. A tall, beautiful
palm tree stands beside it with juicy fruit hanging from its branches.
Healthy plants are all gathered around the still, tranquil water. Even
the sun doesn't seem as bright as it forms a perfect reflection on the
water's surface. A few small creatures drink and play near the water.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains

An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

base of the mountain is fairly steep and its surface is barren of any

The west face of a large mountain blocks passage to the east. This
side of the mountain appears to be the windward side and catches
whatever minimal precipitation happens to be in the air. As such, a
motley collection of plants cling for dear life on the bottom half of
the mountain slope. The desert beyond them to the west is basked in
the oppressive weight of the sun. There are no signs of plants out
there.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The north face of a large mountain blocks passage to the south. Sun
only strikes part of this mountain slope and the rest has the benefit
of some precipitation without the super hot sun to dry it up. As a
result there are a few signs of life on the slope. A nest for a large
bird of prey is perched on a cliff edge while dry-looking trees and
bushes cling to the mountain in various places.

The east face of a large mountain blocks passage to the west. It
towers high over the desert, casting a giant shadow over the land. The
base of the mountain is fairly steep and its surface is barren of any
plant life. The desert around the mountain is populated with the
occasional cactus and scrub brush. Small collections of rocks are
scattered all around the base showing sides of rock slides in the
past.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

the bottom, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over
the place and it would be fun to watch them roll down the hill. A few

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

Atop a small cliff in the desert (n,s,e)
=M= A tiny translucent bombardier beetle.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

A enormous hole in the earth is the most obvious feature of this
section of the desert. As soon as the novelty of that wears off, the
next most obvious feature is that the area is absolutely DRENCHED in
various types of disgusting slime, insect parts, and other junk. Next
to the slime is dried, sun-baked slime. Large tracks of creatures with
many legs lead into and of the hole.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long

still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

The desert landscape is dominated by distant rock walls and mountains
which climb relatively short heights before flattening into plateaus.
An ancient cobblestone road is half covered in sand as it leads off
into the distance in no particular direction, meandering to and fro.
Uncomfortably large insects scurry around underfoot and hide in the
cracks of the road. An old wheel sits on the side of the road
collecting dust.

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

The base of a large cliff towers above you blocking all travel to the
north. Stringy vegetation and roots poke out of the cracks between
rocks as they cling for a chance at existence. The bottom of the cliff
plunges into the sand and likely continues down deep into the earth.
The lower level of the cliff is clear of vegetation and rocks in
either direction.

A modest cliff drops away in front of you. It is not large enough to
block travel, but a fall from the top would leave a mark. The land
below spreads out in the distance with few signs of activity. Well off
in the opposite direction a desert twister moves across the horizon
leaving a trail of dust in the air. Tracks abound in this area showing
signs of desert predators hunting for prey. The sun bakes down from
above heating the surface of the rocks.

An ancient collection of ruins lie partially buried in the sand.
Remnants of civilization are prevalent everywhere in the form of clay
pots, tools, statues and shattered pillars. A once mighty civilization
occupied these lands from the looks of it but they have become as
lifeless as the dust that now covers everything. Tall, but dried out
trees stand next to broken buildings as the only living things in the
area.

The bleak landscape is punctuated here by the presence of an ancient
skeleton which has sat undisturbed for decades. The sand has brushed
every surface smooth and all traces of organic material have been long
since carried off by carrion. An ancient spear is clutched in the
still closed hand of this ancient victim of the wastes. The area is
otherwise uninteresting.

Hot desert air blasts down from a cloudless sky that spreads overhead.
The sickly blue dome above is broken in its limitless expansion only
by the glowing hot orb that is the sun. The ground is a series of
baked and cracked rings of dirt that are decorated only by the holes
created from the brief rains that infrequently visit this wasteland.
Scattered here and there are a few dead or dying bushes of the
prickly, stout kind one expects to see in the desert.

top, or east along the cliff edge. Large boulders lie all over the
