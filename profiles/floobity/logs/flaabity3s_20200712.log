Surprisingly the inside of the structure is nothing like the complex
outside.  Everything is meticulously clean, with white walls and a
white marble floor.  The room is filled with unusual items that have
colorful blinking lights.  A strange high tech throne sits on the
middle of the room.  The throne is the centerpiece of a huge symbol
that is embedded within the marble floor.  There is no apparent light
source in the room, yet the room is brightly lit.  The ceiling is
strangely transparent, yet you cannot see anything through it.
