You feel closer to the chaos flux and more intimate with your current form.
Giant Donut gurgles in its own blood as it dies.
Fl dealt the killing blow to Giant Donut.
Your reputation with Donut Slayers has increased slightly.
Giant Donut's impaled body crumples lifelessly to the ground.              
You pick up The sliced up, freshly slain corpse of Giant donut and wrap it up into the coffin's
protective hold!
The coffin is now full!
There are no coins here to share!
The coffin expels a corpse onto the ground!
You flow over the corpse, creating a lucid bioplast with the raw protoplasm
you obtain.                                                                
bioplast: Taken.
Clone can't carry that much more.
There are no corpses here to wrap!
You relinquish yourself to Chaos, and immediately feel the unpredictable
and powerful forces surge through you, threatening to sweep you away in an
instant!
--> You sense an approaching surge of chaotic energy <--
The chaotic forces seeking control of you begin to wane, your control
returning as the energies cease to course chaotically through you.

Mmm, the delicious smell of cinnamon floats along the air in this
spacious corridor. The pungent spice seems to coat every surface you
can see. It flakes off the ceiling and walls and covers the floor in a
thin, fragrant layer. Cinnamon is said to be good for you, but you
might want to be careful. There's enough of it in here to choke a
horse.
