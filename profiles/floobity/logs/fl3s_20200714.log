07:17 To: Hayt : yesterday in wandering average damage was 2209.4866
07:17 To: Hayt : today is 2357.7097
07:18 Hayt : so 4.4%ish
07:18 To: Hayt : so uhh, yeah, about 5%
07:18 To: Hayt : not a lot
07:18 To: Hayt : but I don't think I have any complaints about our damage
07:19 To: Hayt : I'd really like to see defense scale more
07:19 To: Hayt : offensive forms are already beast-mode damage doers
07:51 To: Hayt : i also made a pokedex for the biome :p
07:51 To: Hayt : records form info and room numbers for the mapper and
                 stuff, so i can find them again
07:52 To: Hayt : near as i can tell there are 195 forms
07:52 To: Hayt : i exported the whole thing to google docs as well

07:54 Castiel : I'm 11-12 hours of gxp away from God Emperor
07:54 To: Castiel : excellent
07:55 Hayt : neat ;D
07:55 Castiel : Yeah, kinda rather play my jedi lol
07:55 Castiel : but I'm worried they'll nerf the gxp and this is the best
                use of time in the short run
07:56 Hayt : this is cool
07:56 To: Hayt : which?
07:56 Hayt : the spreadsheet
07:57 To: Hayt : if you wanna use the real thing you can switch to tintin!
07:57 To: Hayt : all the cool kids are doing it
07:57 Hayt : i use tiny fugue right now but maybe i'll do that :D
07:57 To: Hayt : yeah i used tf before
07:58 To: Hayt : and the tintin mapper convinced me to switch
07:58 Hayt : well shit
07:58 Hayt : can u tintin mobile?
07:58 To: Hayt : yep.  thats what i am doing right now
07:58 Hayt : sounds like quite the project
07:59 To: Hayt : ive written some fancy stuff.  we have a discord channel
                 if you wanna give it a go
07:59 Hayt : not sure i'd be up for converting all my aliases,
             triggers, etc but i guess i can look into it ;D
07:59 Hayt : oh jeeze
07:59 Hayt : sure i can check it out
07:59 Hayt : very kind of you
07:59 To: Hayt : i wrote an automapper.  lets you fight in d2
07:59 Hayt : that's what im talkin about
08:00 Hayt : yeah i'd love to check it out
08:00 Hayt : you must be a developer
08:00 To: Hayt : https://discord.gg/RR4cVgE
08:00 Hayt : im popedog
08:00 To: Hayt : im a server engineer, but we have a bunch of developers
08:01 Hayt : sick

08:18 Hayt : even in max tank form
08:18 Hayt : wl
08:26 Castiel : coins come much easier on bigger toons for sure
17:03 Castiel : a new member
17:04 To: Castiel : the group is growing too big for me to hold everybody's
                    hand :P
17:08 Castiel : wastovan wont need much handholding
17:08 Castiel : dude has a phd in computer science
18:46 To: Wastovan : everything going alright?
18:54 Wastovan : I was afk for a mtg actually and just back here :0
21:02 To: Korenth : I don't suppose you can look at teepo blasters while you
                    are looking at jedis.  They definitely don't feel
                    comparatively great right now
05:43 Atropos : tanking upped, try it out
05:44 To: Atropos : I dig it!
05:45 To: Atropos : also like the changes to sp usage
05:58 To: Goo : tanking is upped :P
05:59 To: Goo : I like it when changelings get a little love
06:09 Atropos : i might break something so finish up mob and stay out of
                combat
06:10 To: Atropos : done
06:44 Hayt : in the client
You will no longer see the HP bar on the main screen.
You remove your setting for MAPCOLS.
You will now see the HP bar on your main screen as well.
From afar, Castiel tips his hat to you.
woo hayt
From afar, you go 'Woo Woo!' at Hayt.
The chaotic forces seeking control of you begin to wane, your control
returning as the energies cease to course chaotically through you.
You relinquish yourself to Chaos, and immediately feel the unpredictable
and powerful forces surge through you, threatening to sweep you away in an
instant!

gibber castiel
From afar, you gibber on and on and on to Castiel.
Castiel tells you: floobot's popularity is building momentum lol
Your body ripples and shakes as energy flows into you.
grin castiel
From afar, you grin at Castiel.
