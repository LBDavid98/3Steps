Hovering far in the air here is a strange looking hemispherical structure.  You could probably jump up to it if you wanted.

From the south comes the sounds of animated discussion of the players and wizards of 3S.  To the north you can see the Headquarters of the Syndicate.

To see a list of the services provided by The Gypsy, just read the sign found within the shop.  Looking closely, you can see a small staircase leading down into the basement. } {Mud} {} {} {} {1.000} {}

While the interior of the structure is more visually appealing than the exterior, with its soft iridescent glow, its 20 foot vaulted ceiling, and its dark oak counters, there is still the hint of a much rougher underbelly, as evidenced by the dusty and half-worked stones underneath it all.  People mill around the area, not pausing at all for pleasantries but rather working as efficiently and quickly as possible, then exiting once their transactions are complete.  One wouldn't expect more from the Office of Professional Registration, an organization whose sole purpose is to keep track of the various professions and the people who practice it. } {Mud} {} {} {} {1.000} {}
